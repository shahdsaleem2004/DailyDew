# DailyDew 🧴

## Project Overview
DailyDew is a full-stack personalized skincare recommendation platform designed to analyze user inputs and generate customized skincare routines based on structured decision logic and database-driven product data.

Built as a team project, the system integrates a Java Servlet backend with an SQL database to deliver dynamic content, rule-based skin classification, and personalized product recommendations.

## Academic Context

DailyDew was developed as a team-based project for the Web Application Programming course.  

The project focused on applying full-stack development principles, backend logic implementation, and relational database integration in a real-world web application environment.

## Project Timeline

🗓 Development Period: January 2025 – May 2025  

The system was designed, implemented, and tested collaboratively during this academic period.
